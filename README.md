# jotto

Jotto is a word game that I play with my partner, generally at brunch on little pieces of paper. The objective is to each choose a five-letter word (which we keep to ourselves), and then we take turns guess each others' word through the process of elimination. There are no repeat letters in the "simple" version. 

I built Jotto as my bootcamp final project using Javascript, jQuery/AJAX, HTML and CSS. I stored the word dictionaries with Amazon S3, and had to create a searchable CSV to do so. I also incorporated authorization and authentication along with a User Profile (with the option to upload a photo) to store the number of guesses and words in a Leaderboard. 

I built it in SublimeText 2 and deployed with Heroku.
